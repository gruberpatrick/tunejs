This curious, three-decade-late, stripped-down rethink offers up yet another spin on what started as a back-to-the-roots album/documentary project called Get Back in January, 1969, but ended up as the band's de facto swan song 18 months later. Paul McCartney in particular has long been irked by producer Phil Spector's grandiose orchestra and choir overdubs to the title track and \"The Long and Winding Road,\" and indeed the \"bare\" versions here have a distinct, plaintive charm lacking in Spector's typical pomp. All the various snippets of studio and live chatter that seasoned the original have been removed, leaving the recordings to be judged on their essentially live-in-the-studio merits. If the intent was to \"de-Spectorize\" the album, the inclusion of John Lennon's 1968 benefit track \"Across the Universe\" and George Harrison's \"I Me Mine\" (which marked the last-ever Beatles session in January, 1970) in their original versions seems equally odd, the legendary producer having appended them to the album's original track listing in the first place. The rambling \"bonus disc\" of conversation and song snippets culled from hundreds of hours of session and film tapes may fascinate diehard fans, but it also underscores the murky, often unfocused state of affairs the Fabs found themselves in during the last year of their remarkable career. --Jerry McCulley","sComposer":"John Lennon/Paul McCartney","sArtist":"The Beatles","lAdded":1418572767,"lBitrate":0,"lLength":0,"lSize":0,"lSampleRate":0,"lChannels":0,"lLastPlay":0,"lLastSkip":0,"lPlayCount":0,"lSkipCount":0,"sPath":"/media/patrick/swap/music/general/rock/11-Let It Be.mp3","lId":null},"/media/patrick/swap/music/general/rock/13 The Brightest Lights.mp3":{"sAlbumArtist":"King Charles","sTitle":"The Brightest Lights","sAlbum":"LoveBlood","sGenre":"Indie","sYear":"2012","sTrackNumber":"08/11","sComment":"eng\u0000","sComposer":"Charles Costa","sArtist":"King Charles & Mumford And Sons","lAdded":1418572767,"lBitrate":0,"lLength":0,"lSize":0,"lSampleRate":0,"lChannels":0,"lLastPlay":0,"lLastSkip":0,"lPlayCount":0,"lSkipCount":0,"sPath":"/media/patrick/swap/music/general/rock/13 The Brightest Lights.mp3","lId":null},"/media/patrick/swap/music/general/rock/18 Labrinth - Express Yourself.mp3":{"sArtist":"Labirinth","sAlbum":"","sComment":"\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000","sGenre":"Pop","sTitle":"Express Yourself","lAdded":1418572767,"lBitrate":0,"lLength":0,"lSize":0,"lSampleRate":0,"lChannels":0,"lLastPlay":0,"lLastSkip":0,"lPlayCount":0,"lSkipCount":0,"sPath":"/media/patrick/swap/music/general/rock/18 Labrinth - Express Yourself.mp3","lId":null},"/media/patrick/swap/music/general/rock/20-Lady Madonna.mp3":{"sAlbum":"1","sTitle":"Lady Madonna","sYear":"2000","sTrackNumber":"20","sAlbumArtist":"The Beatles","sGenre":"Rock","sComment":"engProving yet again their willingness to dice 'n' slice their burgeoning legacy into new--if not exactly fresh--product, the Fab Four Minus One have released this single-disc compendium of their No. 1 hits. Though obviously superfluous to the faithful (who may also find themselves quibbling over the precise definition of \"No. 1 hit\" and the exclusion of seeming contenders like \"Please Please Me\" and \"Strawberry Fields\"), newly arrived visitors from the Pleiades star cluster and other neophytes will find it a concise and generous (nearly 80 minutes) single-disc introduction to the band's career-spanning, unparalleled dominance of pop music in the 1960s. But beyond being a mere trophy case of commercial success (and it won't be hard to find critics who'll argue that these singles aren't even the band's best work), it's also a Cliff's Notes take on a remarkable seven-year run of musical evolution, one that stretches from the neo-skiffle of \"Love Me Do\" through a remarkable synthesis of R&B, rockabilly, Tin Pan Alley, gospel, country, and classical that still defies efforts to effectively deconstruct it. This is the pop monument equivalent of the '27 Yankees and '90s Bulls; it's every bit as obvious and dominating--and just as essential. --Jerry McCulley","sComposer":"John Lennon/Paul

Though obviously superfluous to the faithful (who may also find themselves quibbling over the precise definition of \"No. 1 hit\" and the exclusion of seeming contenders like \"Please Please Me\" and \"Strawberry Fields\"), newly arrived visitors from the Pleiades star cluster and other neophytes will find it a concise and generous (nearly 80 minutes) single-disc introduction to the band's career-spanning, unparalleled dominance of pop music in the 1960s. But beyond being a mere trophy case of commercial success (and it won't be hard to find critics who'll argue that these singles aren't even the band's best work), it's also a Cliff's Notes take on a remarkable seven-year run of musical evolution, one that stretches from the neo-skiffle of \"Love Me Do\" through a remarkable synthesis of R&B, rockabilly, Tin Pan Alley, gospel, country, and classical that still defies efforts to effectively deconstruct it. This is the pop monument equivalent of the '27 Yankees and '90s Bulls; it's every bit as obvious and dominating--and just as essential. --Jerry McCulley","sComposer":"John Lennon/Paul McCartney","sArtist":"The Beatles","sLength":"258000","lAdded":1418572851,"lBitrate":0,"lLength":0,"lSize":0,"lSampleRate":0,"lChannels":0,"lLastPlay":0,"lLastSkip":0,"lPlayCount":0,"lSkipCount":0,"sPath":"/media/patrick/swap/music/general/rock/the beatles   come together -
