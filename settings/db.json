Will Love You Monday (365)","sArtist":"Aura Dione","sAlbum":"Columbine","lYear":2009,"sComment":"Danish singer/guitarist with a twist: Aura Dione lives her inner child with colourful outfits, unconventional lyrics, playful music, and extravagant live-shows. Just don´t think in boxes – call it better art for a better world.\r\n\r\nShe could not have picked a better artist-name for herself. Simply because this 23-year-old beauty from Copenhagen really has an aura about her: Long black hair, bright eyes, a stunning figure and more ambition to succeed than most men could handle. A caterpillar in a cocoon that has been waiting patiently for years. Even though that is probably her biggest weakness. »I need to do something all the time«, she says with a breath taking smile. »My dream scenario would be: Getting up at five thirty in the morning, at seven thirty be down dancing for three hours, then play music for four hours, then one hour in the gym, and then playing a big concert. I mean, every day, 31 days a month. That’s what I want.«\r\n\r\nLonging for a professional career in music all her life, Aura has been with various record-companies in her teenage years, before she travelled the world (Australia and Japan in particular), and returned to Denmark in order to record her first album »Columbine«. A homage to the comic servant in the classic Italian Commedia dell´Arte that also finds its way into the cover-artwork. Just check those colours and squares…\r\n\r\nTELLS HER VIEW\r\n\r\nI am a wild child, a gypsie, a hippie kid, a fashion rebel, I'm Pocahontas meets hardcore Flashdance.\r\nI hope to radiate a hardcore power who scratches on the surface with a pretty exterior.\r\nI make music about freeing yourself, I speak from the heart and I try always to be as open as possible.\r\nI am writing with humour and irony and with a desire to make a positive difference with my music, my voice and with my life while I am here.\r\n\r\nReleased in late January 2008 the album »Columbine« got rave reviews, reached the top of the local danish album-charts, and spawned the number-1-single \"Song For Sophie\". A kick-start for Aura - and a big surprise for anyone else. For one, she does not fit into any musical box, and what is more she does not write your stereotypical pop-lyrics either. Instead the 12 songs on »Columbine« are far from being normal. Now Germany discovered this star, this diamond and released »Columbine« Germany.

Now","sAlbum":"Design of a Decade: 1986-1996","sComment":"\"Design of a Decade 1986/1996\" - greatest hits by Janet Jackson \r\nReleased: October 2, 1995 (Europe); October 10, 1995 (U.S.) \r\nRecorded: 1985–1995\r\nGenre: R&B, Pop \r\nLength: 75:36 (American edition); 77:54 (international edition) \r\nLabel: Universal, A&M\r\nProducers: Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Janet Jackson, Jellybean Johnson \r\n\r\nSingles from \"Design of a Decade 1986/1996\":\r\n\"Runaway\" - Released: August 29, 1995 \r\n\"Twenty Foreplay\" - Released: September 2, 1996 \r\n \r\nDesign of a Decade 1986/1996 is the first greatest hits album by American R&B/pop singer Janet Jackson, released in 1995 (see 1995 in music). It was certified double platinum by the RIAA in 1995, and has since sold nearly 9 million copies worldwide.\r\n\r\nAlbum information:\r\nThe album features six of Jackson's hits from Control, seven songs from Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814, one song from janet., and two previously unreleased songs, the top five hit \"Runaway\" and the mid-tempo ballad \"Twenty Foreplay\". A video compilation, featuring all the songs on the album (with the exception of \"Twenty Foreplay\"), was released concurrently with the album.\r\n\r\nOwing to licensing difficulties, several later singles that were big hits—including \"If\", \"Again\", \"Any Time, Any Place\", \"Because of Love\", and \"You Want This\"—were omitted from the track listing. Other singles that failed to make the cut included the UK single \"Funny How Time Flies (When You're Having Fun)\" (from 1986's Control). Several tracks were shortened in order to include \"Whoops Now\" and \"The Best Things in Life Are Free\" on the international release.\r\n\r\nThe album was released as an 18-track disc internationally and as a 16-track disc in the U.S. (omitting Whoops Now and The Best Things in Life Are Free). Some versions of the international edition came with a 7-track bonus disc. This bonus disc was also released individually in Australia. Another limited edition version, housed in a metal case and containing the 18-track version of the album, was released in the UK.\r\n\r\nIn the booklet, it shows the lyrics to only the new songs, it shows a mini-biography about Janet, it shows different pictures of her from the times of Control, Rhythm Nation 1814 and janet. It also shows the covers of the singles for the new songs when it shows the lyrics and song credits for the new songs.\r\n\r\nTrack listing:\r\n\r\n\"Runaway\" 4 – 3:35 \r\n\"What Have You Done for Me Lately\" 1 – 4:44 \r\n\"Nasty\" 1 – 4:03 \r\n\"When I Think of You\" 1 – 3:56 \r\n\"Escapade\" 2 – 4:45 \r\n\"Miss You Much\" 2 – 4:12 \r\n\"Love Will Never Do (Without You)\" 2 – 4:35 \r\n\"Alright\"

Naked","sYear":"2003","sTrackNumber":"11","sGenre":"Rock","sAlbumArtist":"The Beatles","sComment":"Re-recorded, remixed, overdubbed and repackaged--all before its 1970 American release, mind you--Let It Be has long been the most second-guessed album in the Beatles otherwise sterling catalog. This curious, three-decade-late, stripped-down rethink offers up yet another spin on what started as a back-to-the-roots album/documentary project called Get Back in January, 1969, but ended up as the band's de facto swan song 18 months later. Paul McCartney in particular has long been irked by producer Phil Spector's grandiose orchestra and choir overdubs to the title track and \"The Long and Winding Road,\" and indeed the \"bare\" versions here have a distinct, plaintive charm lacking in Spector's typical pomp. All the various snippets of studio and live chatter that seasoned the original have been removed, leaving the recordings to be judged on their essentially live-in-the-studio merits. If the intent was to \"de-Spectorize\" the album, the inclusion of John Lennon's 1968 benefit track \"Across the Universe\" and George Harrison's \"I Me Mine\" (which marked the last-ever Beatles session in January, 1970) in their original versions seems equally odd, the legendary producer having appended them to the album's original track listing in the first place. The rambling \"bonus disc\" of conversation and song snippets culled from hundreds of hours of session and film tapes may fascinate diehard fans, but it also underscores the murky, often unfocused state of affairs the Fabs found themselves in during the last year of their remarkable career. --Jerry McCulley","sComposer":"John Lennon/Paul McCartney","sArtist":"The Beatles","lAdded":1418572767,"lBitrate":320,"lLength":233,"lSize":0,"lSampleRate":44100,"lChannels":2,"lLastPlay":0,"lLastSkip":0,"lPlayCount":0,"lSkipCount":0,"sPath":"/media/patrick/swap/music/general/rock/11-Let It Be.mp3","lId":null,"lYear":2003,"lTrack":11},"/media/patrick/swap/music/general/rock/13 The Brightest Lights.mp3":{"sAlbumArtist":"King Charles","sTitle":"The Brightest Lights","sAlbum":"LoveBlood","sGenre":"Indie","sYear":"2012","sTrackNumber":"08/11","sComment":"","sComposer":"Charles Costa","sArtist":"King Charles & Mumford And Sons","lAdded":1418572767,"lBitrate":268,"lLength":216,"lSize":0,"lSampleRate":44100,"lChannels":2,"lLastPlay":0,"lLastSkip":0,"lPlayCount":0,"lSkipCount":0,"sPath":"/media/patrick/swap/music/general/rock/13 The Brightest Lights.mp3","lId":null,"lYear":2012,"lTrack":8},"/media/patrick/swap/music/general/rock/18 Labrinth - Express Yourself.mp3":{"sArtist":"Labirinth","sAlbum":"","sComment":"","sGenre":"Pop","sTitle":"Express Yourself","lAdded":1418572767,"lBitrate":320,"lLength":243,"lSize":0,"lSampleRate":44100,"lChannels":2,"lLastPlay":0,"lLastSkip":0,"lPlayCount":0,"lSkipCount":0,"sPath":"/media/patrick/swap/music/general/rock/18 Labrinth - Express Yourself.mp3","lId":null,"lYear":0,"lTrack":0},"/media/patrick/swap/music/general/rock/20-Lady Madonna.mp3":{"sAlbum":"1","sTitle":"Lady Madonna","sYear":"2000","sTrackNumber":"20","sAlbumArtist":"The Beatles","sGenre":"Rock","sComment":"Proving yet again their willingness to dice 'n' slice their burgeoning legacy into new--if not exactly fresh--product, the Fab Four Minus One have released this single-disc compendium of their No. 1 hits. Though obviously superfluous to the faithful (who may also find themselves quibbling over the precise definition of \"No. 1 hit\" and the exclusion of seeming contenders like \"Please Please Me\" and \"Strawberry Fields\"), newly arrived visitors from the Pleiades star cluster and other neophytes will find it a concise and generous (nearly 80 minutes) single-disc introduction to the band's career-spanning, unparalleled dominance of pop music in the 1960s. But beyond being a mere trophy case of commercial success (and it won't be hard to find critics who'll argue that these singles aren't even the band's best work), it's also a Cliff's Notes take on a remarkable seven-year run of musical evolution, one that stretches from the neo-skiffle of \"Love Me Do\" through a remarkable synthesis of R&B, rockabilly, Tin Pan Alley, gospel, country, and classical that still defies efforts to effectively deconstruct it. This is the pop monument equivalent of the '27 Yankees and '90s Bulls; it's every bit as obvious and dominating--and just as essential. --Jerry McCulley","sComposer":"John Lennon/Paul

2008. Their first single. `I'm Not Gonna Teach Your Boyfriend How To Dance With You' entered the UK Charts at #11. `Partie Traumatic' was produced by former Suede guitarist Bernard Butler and is choc-full of equally effervescent pop songs just waiting to be heard. Judging by their live shows the song is an indie disco anthem in the making. A dash of disco, a dash or two of heartbreak and a rousing chorus, what else do you need? Sony.

In truth, the trio's got some lofty ambitions, and The Moon and Antarctica indulges their grand dreams with pristine production and a vivid sonic backdrop. It also dives deeply into their geographical obsessions--always with the same subjective twists that made The Lonesome Crowded West and This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About such inspired wonders. Isaac Brock opens Moon with meditations on the universe's shape--all twisted into such a solipsistic tangle that they illuminate immediately how much these songs are about the mind as about the world. Rarely giving off the cage-jarring thickness of guitar rock, Moon's 15 tunes are shaped around vignettes of a disheveled head figuring out the rambling disconnections of postmodern society. Guitars wobble, Brock wails on vocals, and his band mates--Eric Judy and Jeremiah Green--help take each song away from any predictable formula and toward wherever they seem to want to go. This is a band as profoundly touched by suburbia as was writer Harold Brodkey. You can imagine Brock, Green, and Judy lying on wide-open lawns, philosophizing about the shape of the universe and coming up with lyric moments like this (sung to folky, spare acoustic guitar): \"A wild pack of family dogs came running through the yard and as my own dog ran away I didn't say much of anything at all / A wild pack of family dogs came running through the yard as my little sister played; the dogs took her away, and I guess she was eaten up, okay.\" Replays of American Beauty, anyone? --Andrew

Lines from \"I Am a Rock\" (\"For a rock feels no pain / And an island never cries\") and the title track (\"Fools, said I, you do not know / Silence like a cancer grows\") are the essence of sophomoric poetry. And who but a couple of self-serious young men would sequence the suicide odes \"Richard Cory\" and \"A Most Peculiar Man\" back to back? That said, every callow couplet found here is counterbalanced by words that are disarmingly guileless. The unabashed romanticism of \"Kathy's Song\" is truly poignant; it ranks with \"For Emily\" and \"The Only Living Boy in New York\" among the duo's most resplendent performances. \"April Come She Will\" has a similar innocent appeal, while the title track, despite its overwrought moments and Tom Wilson's tacked-on production, is a folk-rock landmark. It's not hard to find fault with The Sounds of Silence, but it's easier still to bask in its inchoate splendor. (The 2001 reissue adds the bonus track \"The Blues Run the Game\" plus three unreleased 1970 demos.) --Steven Stolder","sArtist":"Simon & Garfunkel","sGenre":"Folk

Though obviously superfluous to the faithful (who may also find themselves quibbling over the precise definition of \"No. 1 hit\" and the exclusion of seeming contenders like \"Please Please Me\" and \"Strawberry Fields\"), newly arrived visitors from the Pleiades star cluster and other neophytes will find it a concise and generous (nearly 80 minutes) single-disc introduction to the band's career-spanning, unparalleled dominance of pop music in the 1960s. But beyond being a mere trophy case of commercial success (and it won't be hard to find critics who'll argue that these singles aren't even the band's best work), it's also a Cliff's Notes take on a remarkable seven-year run of musical evolution, one that stretches from the neo-skiffle of \"Love Me Do\" through a remarkable synthesis of R&B, rockabilly, Tin Pan Alley, gospel, country, and classical that still defies efforts to effectively deconstruct it. This is the pop monument equivalent of the '27 Yankees and '90s Bulls; it's every bit as obvious and dominating--and just as essential. --Jerry McCulley","sComposer":"John Lennon/Paul McCartney","sArtist":"The Beatles","sLength":"258000","lAdded":1418572851,"lBitrate":320,"lLength":258,"lSize":0,"lSampleRate":44100,"lChannels":2,"lLastPlay":0,"lLastSkip":0,"lPlayCount":0,"lSkipCount":0,"sPath":"/media/patrick/swap/music/general/rock/the beatles   come together -
